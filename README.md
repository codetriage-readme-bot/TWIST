This is the repository containing code & schematics for the TWIST platform.
The basic 3 sensors code is included.
Contributions to the sensor repository are welcome.
The DIY Instructions to make TWIST can be found on http://www.instructables.com/id/TWIST-DIY-Tweeting-Weather-Station/


This also includes a folder 'TWIST Library BETA' which contains the code for the TWIST library that I am currently working on. Note that its currently in the primitive beta stage and is not suited for implementation. Once completed I will accept contributions and bug error reports,etc.
